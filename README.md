# Mixed-Diffusion Trajectories

This file contains the instructions and information about the Mixed-Diffusion Trajectories project.

## Instructions

``mixed_diffusion.ipynb`` is a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for generating mixed-diffusion trajectories and visualizing the results. To run the notebook, ensure you have the required dependencies installed and follow the steps outlined in the notebook. This notebook serves as a guide for understanding the implementation and results.

Results obtained in the paper are obtained by running the code in ``clustering_benchmark.py``, and ``sensitivity_analysis.py``. These scripts can be run from the command line. Please refer to the comments in the scripts for more details on how to use them.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
